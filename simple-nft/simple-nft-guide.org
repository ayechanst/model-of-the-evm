- All accounts have an address
*** What is the user doing?
**** Generating a wallet (on the local hardhat chain)
***** First an ethereum address is created
1. A private key is generated (random 256-bit number)
2. A public key is derived from the private key using elliptical curve cryptography
3. An address is created from the keccak hash of the public key
***** If the user has a wallet, they can add these keys to it
**** Signing in to the dApp
***** A protocol such as WalletConnect establishes a connection between a users private keys and the dApp
***** The user can now sign transactions to interact with the dApp
**** What is a crypto wallet?
***** Enable the storage of public and private keys
*** Grabbing funds from a faucet
**** A faucet is a contract that can send currency
**** The user signs a transaction to the contract calling a "pay" function
**** The faucet sends a transaction with currency to the address of the user

** Checkpoint 2: Minting
*** NFT's
**** Smart contracts
*** What is the user doing?
**** Submitting a transaction to the NFT contract
**** Receiving a NFT (smart contract) at their address
