What is a wallet?

> A wallet holds the keys to your accounts

So what is an account?

## **Accounts** are train stations 

<details><summary>üîç Explore the train station üöâ</summary>

An account is a very cozy little train station that lives on a gigantic block in outer space. As you stand in front of the train station, you see a tranquil little pond with lilly pads, and you can smell the mud and feel the freshness radiating from the little pond. You can taste familiarity when you stand on the little cobblestone path leading up to the train stations front door.

Accounts have the following things attributed to them: 
1. A **private key**
2. A **public key** 
3. An **address** 
4. A **balance**
5. A **nonce**

To lock these away in your memory so that you never forget these things, read the following to see where these things are stored.

### The address üè°
> As you face the train station, you see a very worn out wooden board hanging right above the front door. A huge wooden board held by 2 wooden pillars towers above the train station with an **address** written on it so big and bold it can be seen from miles away. The board has bright yellow lights all around it so it can be seen even at night.

An account has an address, so that people can send things to the account.

### The public key
> You walk up to the train station and notice a big hook with a huge rusty key on it. This key is the **public key** and anyone can see it, it's out in the open. 

Accounts have a public key, which is where the account **address** is derived from.

### The private key üö™
> Although the train station is old and cozy, the door is made of polished metal with an enourmous chain wrapping it. On the chain is a gigantic lock swinging back and forth in the wind. Only someone with a **private key** can open this lock and do things inside the train station. Equipped with your **private key**, you unlock the door and enter into the train station.

An account cannot be accessed without a private key.

### The private key üóùÔ∏è part 2
> You walk into the train station and to the left is a very small desk. On that desk you see envelopes and melted wax. You take a closer look at the private key and notice the end of the handle is a big wax stamp. The **private key** is both a key to open the door to the train station, but also to stamp paper letters with a signature. 

An account can send **signed** transactions with its **private key**. We will talk about transactions and signatures later.

### Balance ‚öñÔ∏è
> On the left side of the room you see a big balance with coins over flowing from it. The coins are so bright that whole corner of the train station is glowing with a yellow hue. A small flying robot is weighing and counting the coins, and has a digital screen on its back displaying the total amount of coins there. Its back is displaying the **balance** of this train station. 

An account has a balance of tokens.

### Nonce 3Ô∏è‚É£
> On the back wall, there is a small door leading to the train platform. There's a rugged paper on it with a big red number. The number is **nonce** and represents the amounts of trains that have left this train station. 

An account has a nonce, which is a number to track how many transactions this account has sent. Its purpose is the prevent reentrancy attacks and its a security measure. 

### RECAP
An account is controlled by a private key, and public key. An account has an address, a balance, and a nonce. We will add more detial to this little train station as we progress, but for now remember this building. A cozy building with a huge sign above it. A strong metal door and a lock. Inside is a big stamp with a golden key on one end, and another key on the desk. In the back is a poster with a nonce on it.

## A wallet is a robot butler

<details><summary>üîç Explore the robot butler</summary>

Most people who live in blockchain land have robot butlers. These robots are humanoid, are made of shiny chrome, and have a safe instead of an abdomen. Armed to the teeth, no one can steal these private keys from the robot butler.

### Ears
> The butler has round metal ears. When the butler's owner whispers softly a special **seed phrase** in the butler's ears, the butler can access any of the owner's train stations.

Wallets have seed phrases, which as hashed to form a private key. This private key however is the **master private key** that controls all private keys within the wallet. 

### Chest safe
> A butler has a safe in place of its abdomen. It has a a big wheel with lots of handles on it. The owner, if they wish, can whisper the **seed phrase** in the butler's ear and turn the wheel to open the safe. Inside are all of the owner's private keys clinging together as they dangling from hooks on the safe's ceiling. 

Wallets contain and control several pairs of keys. 

### Butler behavior
> Butlers always serve their owners with upmost confidentiality and class. The butler can use the owner's private keys to access any of the owner's train stations. Once the butler is inside the train station it can do anything such as send a train off to a destination, report the balance of that train station back to the owner, and sign important paperwork.

Wallets (behind the scenes) can log into decentralized applications, sign transactions, and much more!

Great now you know what an account is, and what a wallet is. Wallets manage accounts. And accounts are locations.

## ‚õΩÔ∏è Getting funds from the faucet for gas

Ok lets get some gas! Lets see how our analogy holds up so far. Before moving on thought, there a few more analogies/concepts to bring this concept to life!

## Transactions are Trains!

<details><summary>Explore the Train!</summary>

Imagine a big red steam engine on little tracks resting behind our train station. The train smells of charcoal and the air around it trembles under the power of its engine. This train's engine is no ordinary engine and give the train the capacity to fly into outer space! WTF! Three wagons are connected to the train. A wagon full of shiny gold, a wagon full of glowing turquiose metal boxes, and a wagon full of fuel. 

### The Locomotive
> You walk up to the locomotive and take a step to get inside.
