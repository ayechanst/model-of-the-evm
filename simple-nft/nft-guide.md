# Simple NFT Goals:
1. What is an account?
2. What is a wallet?
3. What is a transaction?
4. What is a smart contract?
5. What is an NFT (bonus/not super important atm)


# Checkpoint 1: Gas and Wallets

### What is a wallet?
> A wallet holds the keys to your accounts
So what is an account?

# Accounts are train stations
An account is a very cozy little train station that lives on a gigantic block in outer space. As you stand in front of the train station, you see a tranquil little pond with lilly pads, and you can smell the mud and feel the freshness radiating from the little pond. You can taste familiarity when you stand on the little cobblestone path leading up to the train stations front door.

### The address
As you face the train station, you see a very worn out wooden board hanging right above the front door. A huge wooden board held by 2 wooden pillars towers above the train station with an **address** written on it so big and bold it can be seen from miles away. The board has bright yellow lights all around it so it can be seen even at night.

### The door
Although the train station is old and cozy, the door is made of polished metal with an enourmous chain wrapping it. On the chain is a gigantic lock swinging back and forth in the wind. 

### Walking through the door
Imagine you are a tiny little mouse. You hop through the lock and inside you see a desk with a huge stamp on it very messy with red wax spilling all over the table.
