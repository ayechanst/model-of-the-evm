# Simple NFT Goals:
1. What is an account? => A train station
2. What is a wallet?
3. What is a transaction?
4. What is a smart contract?
5. What is an NFT (bonus/not super important atm)


# Checkpoint 1: Gas and Wallets

### What is a wallet?
> A wallet holds the keys to your accounts
So what is an account?

# Accounts are train stations
An account is a very cozy little train station that lives on a gigantic block in outer space. As you stand in front of the train station, you see a tranquil little pond with lilly pads, and you can smell the mud and feel the freshness radiating from the little pond. You can taste familiarity when you stand on the little cobblestone path leading up to the train stations front door.

> An account is a location on the blockchain. It has the following features:

### The address 
> As you face the train station, you see a very worn out wooden board hanging right above the front door. A huge wooden board held by 2 wooden pillars towers above the train station with an **address** written on it so big and bold it can be seen from miles away. The board has bright yellow lights all around it so it can be seen even at night.

An account has an address, so that people can send things to the account.

### The door
> Although the train station is old and cozy, the door is made of polished metal with an enourmous chain wrapping it. On the chain is a gigantic lock swinging back and forth in the wind. Only someone with a **private key** can open this lock and do things inside the train station. 

An account cannot be accessed without a private key.

### Walking through the door (keys)
> Imagine you are a tiny little mouse. You hop through the lock and inside you see a desk with a huge stamp on it very messy with red wax spilling all over the table. The huge stamp's handle is a big golden key. This tool is a **private key** and on a hangar next to it is a smaller key called the **public key**. 

An account has a public key and a private key. 

### Balance
> In the corner of the train station, there is a balance. The balance has a huge pile of glittering coins emmitting bright light. It smells like metal over there. There is a little flying robot weighing the pile of tokens one by one. The robot has a screen display on its back with the current **balance** of the pile of tokens. 

An account has a balance of tokens.

### Nonce
> On the back wall, there is a small door leading to the train platform. There's a rugged paper on it with a big red number. The number is **nonce** and represents the amounts of trains that have left this train station. 

An account has a nonce, which is a number to track how many transactions this account has sent. Its purpose is the prevent reentrancy attacks and its a security measure. 

# RECAP
An account is controlled by a private key, and public key. An account has an address, a balance, and a nonce. We will add more detial to this little train station as we progress, but for now remember this building. A cozy building with a huge sign above it. A strong metal door and a lock. Inside is a big stamp with a golden key on one end, and another key on the desk. In the back is a poster with a nonce on it.
