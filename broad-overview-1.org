**Ethereum Protocol Learning Outline**

* 1. Broad Overview
** 1. What is it about?
- The topic is the EVM
- The layperson could not grasp the EVM fully in detail within a few hours, but it is not as complex as nuclear physics
- Someone would need to understand several different things to grasp it fully

** 2. How extensive is the subject?
There are several facets of the Ethereum Protocol
- Blockchains
- Ethereum
- Ether
- Smart Contracts

** 3. What acts as an appropriate starting point? 
Blockchains
* 2. Narrowing the Steps 
How many parts/levels can the EVM be deconstructed into?
** Deconstructing the topic of the Ethereum Protocol
*** The Ethereum Protocol (the blockchain level of things)
**** Blockchains
***** Hash Functions
***** Merkel Trees
***** Accounts
****** User Accounts
****** Contract Accounts
***** Blocks
***** Transactions
***** Smart Contracts
**** The EVM
***** Bytes
***** Memory
***** Stack
***** Nodes
***** State
Consists of key value mappings from addresses to account objects
mapping(address => account)
****** Two Types of Account Objects
1. Accounts controlled by private key
   - nonce
   - balance
2. Accounts controlled by code
   - nonce
   - balance
   - code hash (code = empty string for private key controlled accounts)
   - storage trie root (entire set of storage for that account)
***** Code Execution
Every transaction specifies a TO address (unless its creating a contract)
**** Ethereum 
*** Object Oriented Programming

** Combining theory and application
How is the Ethereum Protocol related to OOP?

* 3. Define Success
The reason for learning about the ethereum protocol is to understand concepts within it quicker, because there is a solid foundation.
You will have succeeded in this when you can explain how things are working within the EVM and in what order, and why.
- What
- Where
- When
- Why
