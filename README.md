# Purpose
The purpose of this learning program is to give knowledge to builders. While Speed Run Ethereum builds skills, Platinum Ethereum gives knowledge.

# Difference between skills and knowledge
Skills are acquired through repetition and intuition. Knowledge is just facts and data. A future programmer can have all of the knowledge of JavaScript and not be able to program at all, because they do not have skills.

A great example of programs that teach knowledge and not skills are YouTube videos with titles similar to: "Learn JavaScript in 4 hours!", and "Program in Python in the next 30 minutes!". Of course, after completing these courses viewers are left in front of a blank document with no idea where to start. 

On the other hand, some go-getters hack away at writing JavaScript looking things up as they need them. These people may have the "skill" of writing JavaScript, but without broad knowledge of JavaScript, they may be shooting themselves in the foot by writing programs that could have been much shorter. For example using for loops for every situation instead of a more appropriate forEach, map, filter... 

# Bridging the Gap
Unfortunately giving users the right amount of knowledge at the appropriate time in their skill-building journey without overwhelming them is not obvious. This is the solution Platinum Ethereum seeks to provide for future builders going through Speed Run Ethereum.

The nice thing about Speed Run Ethereum is that if you don't care or want to know about the details of background processes, you don't have to! You can hack your way through the challenges and deduce what certain things do. The problem lies in that intuition is not always right. 

# Building Models
Most of what humans understand is related to a "model" of something. If you understand how a toaster oven works, you probably have a model of it. So when future-builders are using their untrained intuition to build a model of how the Ethereum protocol works from the deduction of their functioning Speed Run Ethereum code, they could be building an incorrect model.

Even worse, when intuition about an Ethereum protocol concept is correct 90% of the time, the intuition becomes "false knowledge". This is very bad for two reasons. One, when encountering a problem, they may never think to question their knowledge until hours or days of head banging against their keyboard. Second, unlearning something to learn the correct way is much harder than learning the correct way the first time.

# Platinum Ethereum
I was thinking about how I could add more information to Speed Run Ethereum. The problem was that I love Speed Run Ethereum the way it is because it does its job flawlessly of Speed Running through Ethereum. Adding bloat and more information to it would change what makes Speed Run Ethereum, Speed Run Ethereum. 

So I thought of a different program/learning aid/resource that is the opposite of Speed Run Ethereum. The name Platinum Ethereum comes from gaming. In gaming, some people speed-run games, and it's super cool. On the opposite end, some people platinum games (getting every single achievement). So the opposite of Speed Run Ethereum can only be Platinum Ethereum. 

# Where to even start explaining the Ethereum Protocol? It's so vast
Standing on the shoulders of giants is always a smart move for rapid advancement. Science as a general field is a great example. So I think that Platinum Ethereum should start right where Speed Run Ethereum starts, with Challenge-0-Simple-NFT. 

This way knowledge is given in tandem with a real-life application! As to not change the identity of Speed Run Ethereum, Platinum Ethereum would be separate. This way speed runners can speed run. Slow runners can jump between the two, and people just seeking information can go through Platinum Ethereum. 

# Design philosophy of Platinum Ethereum
I think having these two learning programs separate is good because people can pick between the two, or combine them in any quantity. So Platinum Ethereum would have 0 things to do on it. Just reading and explaining, but this is where it differs from other blogs/articles/ and resources about the Ethereum protocol. 

Now there are some great videos on crypto such as the YouTube channel WhiteBoard Crypto, but the problem is that videos are really not ideal documentation and maybe their information can be taken for granted since they are so easy to watch.

I love the genuinely fun, colorful, and engaging aesthetic of Speed Run Eth, and I want to bring that into Plat Eth. A lot of blogs have no graphics explaining concepts, or at best a few charts. With Plat Eth I want to do the following:

## 1. Tell a story about the Ethereum Protocol
How do people memorize pi to the 70,000th digit? How do people recite Earnest Hemmingway's "The Old Man and the Sea"? They use memorization techniques that almost always involve stories. Why is it hard to remember historical dates of events during the Revolutionary War but not the general events that led up to the Revolutionary War? Because humans remember things in stories. We are not machines that hold arbitrary information, we are creatures that remember shared stories and events.

Anyway, long story short I think that concepts should be explained as stories. I'll figure the details out for this later and I'm not planning on writing a novel or something too far removed from what the Ethereum protocol actually is. 

## 2. Have artwork representing concepts as metaphors
What better thing to add to a story than pictures and metaphors? I love the pixel art and emojis featured all over Speed Run Eth, and implementing those alongside a story for concepts would be amazing.

## 3. Just make the EVM fun for crying out loud
Although the EVM is interesting, and the technology, cryptography, and processes are very cool, it can be dry at times. And ultimately this dryness creates a barrier to entry for those not motivated or interested enough to fully understand the Ethereum Ecosystem. And those people who would otherwise be amazing builders fall through the cracks! 

# The overall objective of learning platforms in web3
At the end of the day, web3 is growing and needs to onboard as many people as possible. To onboard people from all over the place, the barrier of entry needs to be continually lowered. But not in a way that people are onboarded knowing nothing about Ethereum, rather in an educated and well-rounded way!

#### Side note
The reason for stories and artwork pragmatically are to have people build stronger and **longer lasting** models of concepts. They are fun but not just for fun either because it's probably going to be a lot of work to come up with "artistic design" choices that actually make sense in the context of the Ethereum Protocol.
