# How to use Platinum Ethereum (PLEASE READ)
Platinum Ethereum is a learning program designed to teach the ethereum ecosystem in a way that will stick in your brain. 

## What does Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Harry Potter have in common?
They are cannonical universes with rich lore that attracts fans from all over. How do people seem to remember people, places, factions, events, and endless facts about these universes that do not even exist? People remember stories.

The Platinum Ethereum project aims to create a complete connonical universe with people, places, and things that represent concepts about the ethereum protocol. 

# The SEE Principal
With the SEE principal, you will be able to remember information in a natrual way that does not rely on memorization or recal. You will simply know it. Platinum Eth is designed as a relaxed reading experience where you (the user) must simply follow along and engage your senses and imagination. No hard heavy lifting or thinking. Just a relaxing story.

### S(ense)
Engage your 5 senses! When a concept is described to you, see the physical representation of the concept! Is it a house on the prairie? See the cozy little house on a nice hill. Smell the fresh air of the grass all around. Feel the coldness radiating from the stone walls of the house. Hear the birds chirp in the background!

### E(xaggerate)
Anything described is larger than life (or smaller)! Take special notice of how ridiculous the pictures are! 

### E(nergize)
Create movement with the pictures. Nothing is standing still, everything is in motion!
